# columnfamily

To design tables for a column family database for online shopping, we first need to identify the entities involved in the system. A basic schema could include the following entities:

* Customers
* Products

We can then create column families for each entity, with columns for specific attributes. Here is an example schema:

Customers Column Family

Column Family Name	Column Name	Data Type
customers	customer_id	text
customers	name	text
customers	email	text
customers	address	text
customers	phone_number	text

Products Column Family

Column Family Name	Column Name	Data Type
products	product_id	text
products	name	text
products	price	decimal

Now, to perform insert, delete, update, and search operations for customer data analysis, we can use the following examples:

Insert Operation
To insert a new customer:

INSERT INTO customers (customer_id, name, email, address, phone_number, registration_date) VALUES ('1', 'John Doe', 'john.doe@example.com', '123 Main St', '555-555-55');

Delete Operation
To delete a customer:

DELETE FROM customers WHERE customer_id = '1';

Update Operation
To update a customer's phone number:

UPDATE customers SET phone_number = '555-555-1234' WHERE customer_id = '1';

Search Operation
To search for all orders placed by a customer:

SELECT * FROM orders WHERE customer_id = '1';
